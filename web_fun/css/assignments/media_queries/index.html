        <h1>@MEDIA QUERIES</h1>
        <p>
            CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the device being used to acces the website.
            For example, it can be used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities, and it's orientation. 
            For this course, we will be using it to detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is capable of much more.
