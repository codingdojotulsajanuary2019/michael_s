    /* Relative 
    Relatively positioned elements are positioned based on the same top,right,bottom,and left properties,
    but are simply shifted from where they would normally sit. In a sense adding 
    relative positioning is similar to adding a margin with one very important 
    difference: the elements around a relatively positioned element act as though 
    that shift didnâ€™t exist. They ignore it. */
